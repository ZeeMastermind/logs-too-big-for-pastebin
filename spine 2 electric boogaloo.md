# What is this?

This is a barebone prototype for what the skeleton/spine/whatever of a cyberpunk/fantasy TTRPG should look like.

This one focuses on what the players do. The "Gameplay Loop" looks at how the group handles different parts of the game or run. The "Archetype" sections show example characters through their image and actions. The Archetypes are meant to be tropey

Don't fall into the trap of thinking that the following can only be solved through a narrative system or other simplified system. Think about how you would play out the actions in your current game. Then, think about the best ways to design for the problem (NOT for the interface!)

# Gameplay Loop

The gameplay loop is based on on the fiction. Cyberpunk-Fantasy is about heists, noir, hidden pasts, the impact of technology, societal secrets, fear of the unknown, fear of the other, fear of losing power, fear (just plain fear),  tragedy or muted victory (depends who you ask), apathy towards the modern world, greed, cockroaches in the cracks, survival at any cost, addiction, and just about anything else that fits your fiction of cyberpunk-fantasy.

But it's a heck of a lot easier to frame things as jobs. Even when you don't get paid. Even when nobody's telling you what to do. There always seems to be a score.

## Get the Job

Detail how the players handle the following situations, and any others that may fit the fiction:

*Who's the boss?*

* A fixer with a good rep sets the runners up with a corporate johnson. 
* A landlord or neighbor asks the runners for help. 
* A shady job offer lands on the runners' door.

*What's their offer?*

* Pay sounds about right, job sounds about right, but they always sound right before everything goes to shit.
* They can't pay in nuyen, but it's good for the neighborhood.
* The pay might be a little too good. Are the runners desperate enough?

*What can they tell you?*

* It's a basic rundown. It's not everything you need to know, but it's everything the employer thinks you need to know. Might take a bit of legwork to sort this one out.
* Maps, schematics, profiles- the employer has the whole shebang. All they need is a group to pull it off.
* Either they're stupid or they think you are. All you've got is the objective.

*Can you trust them?*

* Yes
* No
* Who knows? The GM will decide later

*What else happens at the meet?*

* Nothing. Smooth as ice.
* Someone's gunning for your employer, and now they might be gunning for you. If you save your employer, you might learn a bit more, but what about your hides?
* Someone's listening. Do the runners know? Can they tail them?
* Someone's following a runner home. Do they notice? Does anything bad happen to them?
* A bar fight, unrelated to the job, might've been the elf's fault. Drek happens.

## Scout the Target

Each archetype has their own way of handling things. Detail anything not covered there.

## Do the Job

Each archetype has their own way of handling things. Detail anything not covered there.

## Get Paid for the Job or Deal with the Fallout

[TODO- would be same format as "Get the Job"]

## Downtime

Detail how characters become stronger, how they work with their contacts on their off-time, and how they do their shopping. Some archetypes have specific downtime actions.

# Archetype 1: Sammy

## Image

Street-smart street-warrior who accepts pay in nuyen or cash. Might be a bloodthirsty killer, might have a heart of gold, might have a kid sibling living in the barrens who relies on them. But one damn thing is sure: if you poke your nose in Sammy's business, they'll cut off a lot more than your ugly mug. Steel and blood are the Sammy's trade, but on a good day, all they gotta do is flash their cyber eyes to make the flunkies and wanna-bees stand down.

## Actions

Actions are marked with whether they happen while scouting or while doing the job. Some actions are part of other parts of the gameplay loop. Detail how these actions are accomplished

* Stab people
  * Job
* Shoot people
  * Job
* Punch people
  * Job
* Glare at people until they do what you want
  * Scout
* Tough out an onslaught of amateur firepower
  * Job
* Go toe-to-toe with the corporate answer for a street samurai that doesn't measure up. Maybe they don't fight fair- drones, drugs, magic, what have you. But at their core, this nemesis knows that deep down, they'll never be good enough. And it's all the sammy's fault.
  * [Specific? Sure. But in these prototypes, it's important to characterize what people want to do]
  * Job, Fallout
* Parkour!
  * Scout, Job
* Sneak into a facility (Sometimes)
  * Scout, Job
* Evade the laser traps
  * Scout, Job
* Evade the guard patrols
  * Scout, Job
* Time it right to run through the cameras' blindspots
  * Scout, Job
* Save wimpy-ass teammates from danger
  * Job, Fallout

# Archetype 2: The Wizard

## Image

It's not a cocky name if you live up to it. It's just arrogant. The corporate university bored them, it was too slow. And the indenture job to pay off the scholarship was even more of a bore. No research, no excitement. So they bailed and left a bloody trail. They pretend to be an academic interested in the unknown, but really they're just another kind of street addict. A joy-rider. Adrenaline junky. Their team thinks they act reckless to show off their arcane power, but really they just like to be on the edge of death, the edge of the physical and the astral.
