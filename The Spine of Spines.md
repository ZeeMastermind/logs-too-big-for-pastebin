# The Spine of Spines

## Core Dice Mechanic

### Tests

The spine must state how tests are made. The spine must state the different kinds of tests, and how those tests are made.

#### Determining Dice Pools

The spine must state how dice pools are formed. Modifiers may be left general, but it must be stated how they interact with the dice or the difficulty.

If used, skill webs need not be drawn, but how they are used must be. This is the same for any other system that substitutes skills or abilities for each other.

#### Attributes

Attributes must be listed out, since they are used in determining so many other systems.

#### Skills

Skills must be listed out, since they are used in determining so many other systems.

#### Determining Difficulty

The spine must state how difficulty is determined. Situations for combat, magic, etc. may be generalized here, but it must be stated how modifiers interact with the difficulty.

#### Rolling the Dice

The spine must state how dice are counted, what the effects of certain die faces are, and any special abilities or qualities that may affect the dice. This includes special qualities that would not normally be part of this section of the rules (Such as bad luck) which impact the dice rolling mechanic.

#### Difficulty Conversion Chart

The spine must state how difficulty maps to the spine code. This provides a universal way for users of a spine to understand your system's difficulty levels.

| Difficulty    | Spine Code (SC) | 5E Equivalent | 3E Equivalent |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Trivial       | F               | 1             | 2             |
| Easy          | E               | 2             | 3             |
| Average       | D               | 3             | 4             |
| Hard          | C               | 4-5           | 5             |
| Severe        | B               | 6-7           | 6/7           |
| Extraordinary | A               | 8-9           | 8             |
| Inhuman       | S               | 10-11         | 9             |
| Impossible    | X, X+           | 12, 12+       | 10, 10+       |

Use "B+" or "C-" if the difficulty does not fit a spine code perfectly. Reconsider how you are scaling things if you need more granularity than that, as it provides 24 potential levels of difficulty, which may be too much in itself.

## Time

### Turns, Rounds, or "Combat Turns"

The spine must state how turns work.

#### Initiative

The spine must state how to determine what order turns are taken, if characters can get multiple turns per round, etc. The spine must state how initiative can be modified or changed, but need not list out every possibility.

#### Actions

The spine must state the basic structure of actions. How many actions can be taken per turn, what kinds of actions there are, etc. However, the spine need not list out all actions that can be taken.

## Damage and Death

### Death

The spine must state the conditions of death. This includes any systems for avoiding death. If a death condition is based upon a health attribute (such as a condition monitor), this must also be described.

#### Condition Monitors

If condition monitors or a similar system are used, the effects of wounds (If any) must be made clear.

### Damage

The spine must state how characters progress towards death or unconsciousness. In other words: state how characters are hurt. If there are different types of condition monitors, then the different types of damage must be listed.

# Magic Spine

## Traditions

Not all traditions need be listed, but 2-3 examples should be given. The ways that traditions interact with magic must be detailed.

## Spellcasting

### Spellcasting Tests

The methods of casting a spell and taking drain must be detailed. Drain must work the same way for spells and summoning, though they may be affected by different modifiers.

### Spells

Example spells should be given, and formulas/explanations of creating different types of weapons must be given.

## Summoning

### Summoning Tests

The methods of summoning a spirit and taking drain must be detailed. Drain must work the same way for spells and summoning, though they may be affected by different modifiers.

### Spirits

Example spirits should be given, and formulas/explanations of creating different types of weapons must be given.

## Adepts

The benefits and costs of adept powers must be listed. Example powers should be given, and formulas/explanations of creating different types of powers must be given.

## Special

Anything else that exists in the system (Foci, ritual magic, assensing, etc) must be mentioned, but the rules need not be listed out at this point.

# Matrix Spine

## AR, VR, and Connecting

The methods of connecting to the matrix must be listed, and the methods of blocking someone from leaving or tracing them must also be listed (Though they need not have mechanics at this point).

### Personas

The nature of personas- the representation of a sentient (sapient?) matrix user- must be listed.

## Hosts

The nature of hosts- whatever holds information on the matrix- must be listed. If there are nodes within a host or system, the types of nodes must be listed, but need not be detailed.

## Devices

The nature of how physical electronic devices connect to the matrix must be listed. If there are devices that do not connect to the matrix, or ways of preventing a device from connecting to the matrix, these must be listed, but need not be detailed.

## Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics

Or just ICE, or IC. The nature of IC must be listed.

## Hacking

The basic ways to infiltrate, modify, or attack a host, persona, or device must be listed. If there are more than 10 actions possible, only the mechanics for 3-4 are necessary, enough to give future designers a formula for developing the other actions.

# Rigging Spine

## Vehicles and Drones

The ways of enumerating a vehicle or drone must be listed. How they take damage, what actions they have, etc- everything in the Spine of Spines that might apply to a vehicle or drone.

### Piloting/Driving

The method of directly piloting or driving a vehicle/drone must be listed.

### Autopilot

The method of having a vehicle/drone act autonomously must be listed.

# Meat Spine

## Attacking

The way that physical attacks are made must be detailed. This includes both the attack and the defense, as well as damage and soak. Attacks need not use all of these aspects, and they may have more complicated aspects as well. The point is, every roll or obstacle involved in an attack must be detailed.

## Weapons

The attributes of weapons must be listed. Recoil, range, legality, availability, price, and any other aspect of a weapon must be explained and detailed.

Example weapons should be given, and formulas/explanations of creating different types of weapons must be given.

# Character Creation and Advancement Spine

## Character Creation

The values of different options need not be listed out, but instructions on how to use the method of character creation must be listed. If multiple methods can be used (Priority, sum-to-ten, karmagen, lifepacks, etc.), only one need be detailed at this point.

## Advancement

Conversely, the values of advancement should be listed out at this point, as it is a dependency for any future GM section.
